NOTES:

- This is not in typescript and can't use require without using a webpack plugin
  or complicating the configuration, as explained here

     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64549183/how-to-load-a-service-worker-using-webpack-5

  We choose to keep this low level due to our usability requirements.

- To debug in chrome, look at chrome://inspect/#service-workers

- Requires https, except on localhost with chrome or firefox + special config.

- IMPORTANT! On Safari it is **absolutely critical** that this only take a few seconds max to
  respond to any requests.  If it takes longer, then Safari kills the service worker and blacklists
  it so it won't work at all.    Perhaps Firefox and Chrome might do something similar, but
  with different parameters, though I didn't see that.  Figuring out that this is the case
  was pretty difficult for me, since I couldn't find it in any docs anywhere, and somehow I
  just figured it out.  That's why we have a timeout for waiting for stdin, and similar
  comments in io-using-service-worker.ts.
