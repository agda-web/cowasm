# NOTES:
#   - -DJOBS=0 is to completely disable job control, which isn't supported for WASM yet.
#      Right now the first place this fails is in savefd(int from, int ofd), where it uses
#      a fcntl argument that is simply not implemented in WASI yet.  We will probably have
#      to rewrite savefd to use a non-wasi fcntl that we implement.
