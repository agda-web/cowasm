# Dash Terminal Demo in a Web Browser

This is a demo of [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with dash\-wasm in the browser.

Everything is very similar to the terminal package. See that.

You can try this live at https://cowasm.sh or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sagemathinc/cowasm
cd cowasm/packages/cowasm.sh
npm install
npm run serve
```
