# This script works around a weird and surprising behavior of pnpm exec, which
# may also be valid (not sure).  See https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/5068
# Namely, if you do `pnpm exec cpython` say, then it'll run the relevant
# node_modules/.bin/cpython script, but with the current working directory
# as the directory containing node_modules.  I can definitely understand how
# in many settings that would be useful, but for CoWasm's build system it is
# really bad.  Hence this script.
